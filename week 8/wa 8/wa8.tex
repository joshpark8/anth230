  Feedback time!
  This hybrid is a space for us to connect on how the semester is going now that we are halfway through.
  If there is something that is working well, please let me know here.
  If there is something you are struggling with in class that you would like to see changed, this is your time to tell me.
  I welcome critique but not criticism.
  If there is something that is not working, please detail what it is and offer a solution of how you would like to see it changed.
  You are NOT graded on your opinion.
  You are graded on completed/not-completed.
\end{prompt}
I have been enjoying the class so far!
I like the hybrid format of the class and the writing assignments have been really interesting.
No suggestions!
