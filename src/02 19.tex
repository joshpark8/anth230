\subsection{Gender and Hegemony}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gendered Subject Personalities - Subject positions often offer multiple `ways of being' within each category \begin{itemize}
    \item Ex: masculinities
  \end{itemize}
  \item Each subject positionality will be ranked (and valued) based on its adherence to the hegemonic (dominant/privileged) notion of that gender (Hegemonic Gender)
  \item Subject positionalities are typically ideals rather than representative of concrete real world dynamics \begin{itemize}
    \item Often shape our mental maps of reality, whence shaping legal and otherwise concrete societal frameworks
  \end{itemize}
  \item Individuals may occupy one subject position while exhibiting characteristics of another \begin{itemize}
    \item Ex: `tomboy', `dyke', `queer'
  \end{itemize}
  \item Hegemonic Gender intersect with Hegemonic Positionalities/Categories
